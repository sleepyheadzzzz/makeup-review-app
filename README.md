        - Product Idea
            - Intro: a native mobile app for product review
            - Use Case: 
                > Suppose some day you want to buy a lipstick. You opened a browser, typed “lipstick”, googled it and start browsing thousands of options. Looking at options you might start thinking how those colors look on you instead of models – but that’s ok that is something you could image. After a while you found a beautiful color and you spend next few minutes looking for where to buy it. Before finalizing your mind, you want to first look at reviews. You see some simple lines with comment like “perfect on me!” and a 5-star rating, and possibly another “doesn’t fit” with 1-star rating. That’s the time to get confused. It could be better to ask your friend with experience with product but text everyone and ask, “how is this lipstick?”  seems to be a bad idea. 
             - Solution:
                > To help with similar circumstance, we are building a Wechat Mini Program of that a user could investigatea new cosmetic product they would like to try and are curious about the experience of based on review from their friends. In the mini program, I can write about my favorite lipsticks, upload photos of me wearing them and add a video showing how I pick the right color for different outfits. I could also add links to the product I am using or add tags to make the notes searchable by my friends or by public. Other users who searched for this lipstick could see my Notes and reply to leave their comments or clicked the link directly to purchase if one feels like buying, which saves time for both looking for reviews or looking for trustable website for purchase.
